                  As a team at Sacred Hearts, we hold our students to the highest of expectations both in and outside of the classroom. We have a wonderful combination of people and place which will take our students towards the perfection.<br>

  
  As Principal, I use all tools available to motivate staff, students and community to work together to promote the achievement of students.
  <br>
  
  Together, we collaborate and communicate to ensure a better learning environment where all students feel safe, welcomed, and motivated to improve their learning.
  <br>
  
  Cooperative competition in the teaching and learning will obviously help each student to achieve their goal.
